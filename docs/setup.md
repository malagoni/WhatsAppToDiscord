# Setup Steps
Please don't get worried about the number of steps listed here. We wanted to be as detailed as possible :)

1. Go to the [download page](https://github.com/arespawn/WhatsAppToDiscord/releases/latest) and download the version that is right for your computer.

1. The bot will create some files, so to prevent cluttering, create a new folder. Then, move the downloaded file to that folder.

1. Now, go back to the file you downloaded, and run it! (Microsoft Defender SmartScreen may warn you about running the executable as this project is quite small and not well-known, but if you feel unsafe, you can always inspect and run the open source code from GitHub using Node. To skip SmartScreen, you can click on *"More Info"*, then *"Run"*)

</details>
1. Then, just scan the QR code on your phone through WhatsApp. If you need help with that, check [WhatsApp's official help page](https://faq.whatsapp.com/539218963354346/?locale=en_US).
1. You are good to go! Now, you can explore [Commands](commands.md) to learn how to start conversations.

# Linux/MacOS/Non-Windows Users
Because this has been requested a lot, I'm going to type it here in the form of a rant. There's no non-windows specific steps. You may download the binary and run it in your terminal by running `chmod +x WA2DC-Linux` followed by `./WA2DC-Linux` (or whatever your file's name is). There's no difference between platforms. As you may notice, the question is actually about how to run any executable in Linux/MacOS, and not about this project. Also for those trying to run this on a server, you may try searching the following questions on Google:
- How to download a file using `wget` or `curl`?
- How to run an executable in Linux/MacOS?
- How to run an executable in the background in Linux/MacOS?

If you are going to run this on a server, make sure to use proper authentication methods and secure your server, instead of using weak passwords as the bot will have access to your Discord server and more importantly, your WhatsApp account which may include many private information.
