# Commands
You can use the following commands only in `#control-room` created by the bot. Note that all the commands are case-insensitive. So, `list`, `LIST`, and `lIsT` would evaluate the same way.

## pairWithCode
Pairing with your phone number
- Format: `pairWithCode <number with country code>`
- Examples:
    - `pairWithCode 18001231234`: This would give you a code for you to enter on your phone and pair the bot with your phone number.

## start
Starts a new conversation. It can be used with a name or a phone number. 
- Format: `start <number with country code or name>`
- Examples:
    - `start 11231231234`: This would start a conversation with +1 123 123 1234.
