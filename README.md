# WhatsApp To Discord

WhatsAppToDiscord is a Discord bot that uses WhatsApp Web as a bridge between Discord and WhatsApp. It is built on top of [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) and [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) libraries.

Originally created by [Fatih Kilic](https://github.com/FKLC), the project is now maintained by [Arespawn](https://github.com/arespawn) with the blessing of the previous author.
